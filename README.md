SolidWorks Designs Portfolio
This repository contains a some of my SolidWorks design projects, demonstrating my skills in mechanical design and 3D modeling. Below you will find a brief description of each project along with rendered images to showcase the final results.

Project Overviews
1,2 . Reverse-Engineered Part Design
Description: This project involves a part that was designed based on reverse engineering from an existing design file. The process included analyzing the original part to understand its structure and functionality, which was then replicated and optimized in SolidWorks.

3. Audi R8 Surface Modeling
Description: A detailed 3D model of an Audi R8 created entirely using surface modeling techniques in SolidWorks. This project showcases my ability to handle complex surface modeling tasks and reflects detailed attention to the aesthetic and functional aspects of automotive design.

Rendered Images: Include  rendered photos of the final model to display design accuracy.
